- **Event**: Special events on the purchase day (e.g., Christmas Market, Black Friday)
- **CustomerSatisfaction**: Customer satisfaction rating (1-5)
- **ReturnFlag**: Boolean indicating if the product was returned

## Data Preparation
Data preparation involved several steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.
2. **Data Transformation**: Creating new calculated fields such as TotalPrice, Customer Lifetime Value (LTV), and Average Transaction Value.
3. **Data Integration**: Combining data from different sources to create a comprehensive dataset.

## Data Analysis and Visualization
Using Power BI, various visualizations were created to analyze the data:
1. **Sales by Category**: Bar chart showing sales distribution across different product categories.
2. **Online vs. In-Store Sales**: Pie chart comparing online and in-store sales.
3. **Top Products**: Bar chart displaying the most sold products.
4. **Customer Demographics**: Pie charts and bar graphs showing age and gender distribution of customers.
5. **Customer Satisfaction**: Horizontal bar graph representing customer satisfaction ratings.
6. **Payment Methods**: Distribution of payment methods used by customers.
7. **Special Events Impact**: Analysis of sales during special events like Black Friday and Christmas Market.
8. **Shipping Methods**: Breakdown of shipping methods used for online orders.
9. **Regional Sales**: Map highlighting sales data across different regions.

## Insights and Conclusions
